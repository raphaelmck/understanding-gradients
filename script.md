Local change is about overlap.
Gradients encode all possible directional changes at a point.

Everything below serves that sentence.

High-level arc (what the viewer should feel)

“Change depends on direction”

“Direction matters through overlap”

“There is one direction that explains all others”

“That direction is the gradient”

“This is why gradients are everywhere”

Topic flow (with insight + visual intent)
1. Change depends on direction (setup)

Idea: At a point, the function doesn’t have one rate of change.

Standing on a surface → walk in different directions → different height change.

Same location, infinitely many possible changes.

Insight planted:
Change is not a scalar — it’s directional.

Visual:
Point on surface, arrows radiating out.

2. Directional change comes from projection / overlap

Idea: Only the part of your movement aligned with “uphill” actually increases the function.

Decompose motion into:

uphill component

sideways component

Sideways motion contributes nothing.

Insight:
Change = overlap between your direction and a special direction.

This is the conceptual birth of the dot product — but unnamed.

Visual:
Arrow decomposition, perpendicular component highlighted as “wasted”.

3. There exists a direction that explains all others

Idea: If change depends on overlap, then there must be a single vector that encodes all directional changes.

For every direction 
v
v, change = “how much 
v
v overlaps with something”.

That “something” must itself be a vector.

Insight:
Instead of memorizing infinitely many directional derivatives, you store one vector.

This is a big “aha”.

Visual:
Many arrows → one arrow summarizing them.

4. That vector is the gradient

Idea: The gradient is defined so that:

its direction = direction of maximum increase

its length = how steep the increase is

But crucially:

Any directional change is just the overlap with the gradient.

Insight:
Gradients don’t just point uphill —
they encode all local behavior.

Visual:
Gradient arrow + projection of other directions onto it.

5. Why “steepest direction” is not a coincidence

Idea: Among all unit directions, the one with maximal overlap is the gradient itself.

Overlap is maximized when vectors align.

This explains “steepest ascent” without calculus tricks.

Insight:
Steepest ascent is a geometric inevitability, not a formula result.

Visual:
Rotating direction vector, overlap magnitude changing.

6. Why perpendicular directions don’t change the function

Idea: If overlap is zero, there is no change.

Directions perpendicular to the gradient live along level curves.

This explains contour plots instantly.

Insight:
Level sets are orthogonal to gradients because they have to be.

Visual:
Contour lines + normal vector.

7. Why gradients matter (zoom out)

Idea: Gradients compress local complexity into usable information.

They appear whenever:

you want to improve something locally

you want to follow change

you want to approximate nonlinear behavior linearly

Insight:
Gradients are not “optimization tools” —
they are local summaries of reality.

Visual:
Different contexts, same arrow idea reused.

8. Quiet closing insight

End on something reflective, not instructional.

“Once you see gradients as overlap and direction,
they stop being formulas and start being geometry.”
